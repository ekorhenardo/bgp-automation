# BGP Automation
This project automates the testing of the Singapore Goverment's Business Grant Portal (BGP) using Playwright and Java. It includes core test logic for validating key flows, generates Allure reports, and is designed to be extendable with a frontend UI for easier execution and integration.

## Tech Stack
| Tool               | Purpose                        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Playwright (Java)  | Browser automation             |
| JUnit 5            | Test framework                 |
| Allure             | Test reporting                 |
| Maven              | Build & dependency management  |
| Spring Boot        | Frontend UI for execution/reporting  |

## Documentation / Justification
This section explains the flow of how the project was built, along with the reasoning behind each decision.

### 1. Started with Backend (Test Logic)
The first step was building the core test logic using:
- **Playwright with Java** â€” this combination was recommended in the task, and I also wanted to explore it more deeply since it's gaining popularity in modern QA stacks. Itâ€™s a good chance to get hands-on experience with Playwrightâ€™s powerful browser automation while sticking to Java, which is widely used in enterprise environments.
- **JUnit 5** â€” used as the main test framework for writing and organizing the tests.
- **Maven** â€” chosen for managing dependencies, building the project, and eventually integrating with other tools like Allure and Spring Boot.

This backend-first strategy ensured that:
- Tests are runnable independently via command line.
- Core logic and utilities are thoroughly validated.
- Test classes and structure are modular and maintainable.

### 2. Reporting with Allure
After getting the tests running properly, I integrated Allure to generate test reports. This helps visualize test results with:
- Clear breakdowns of steps and outcomes
- Execution time
- Attachments (e.g. screenshots, if added later)

Allure was a good fit because itâ€™s clean, well-documented, and works nicely with JUnit 5. It also sets the stage for future CI/CD integration.

### 3. Simple Frontend
A basic **Spring Boot** UI will be added to trigger test execution from a browser â€” either running all tests or a specific test class. This makes it easier for non-technical users to run the tests without needing the terminal.

Note: For now, it won't show test results yet â€” that might be added later.

## Project Structure
The code is organized into:
- `src/main/java`: Contains main flow logic or utilities that simulate user behavior.
- `src/test/java`: Contains test cases, base setup, and section-level validations.
- Utility files (e.g., BaseTest) to centralize Playwright setup/teardown logic and avoid duplication.


## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Java
```bash
brew install openjdk@17
```
Note: follow the remaining setup for Java that appear in your terminal after running the brew command (setup $JAVA_HOME, symlink, etc).

### 2. Install Maven
```bash
brew install maven
```

### 3. Install Allure
```bash
brew install allure
```

### 4. Verify Installation:
```bash
java -version
mvn -v
allure --version
```

## How to Run Tests

### Run All Test Cases
```bash
mvn clean test
```

### Run Specific Test Class
```bash
mvn clean test -Dtest=ContactDetailsSectionTest
```
Note: the command above will run all test cases under **ContactDetailsSectionTest.java** file.

## How to View Allure Reports

1. Run Tests to Generate Results

    This creates the allure-results/ folder:

    ```bash
    mvn clean test
    ```

2. Generate the Allure Report

    ```bash
    allure generate --clean
    ```

3. Open the Report in Browser

    ```bash
    allure open
    ```
